                  <p style="font-family:Montserrat;">We at Dev/track are dedicated to helping students upskill their stacks while diversifying
                     their portfolios.Each idea comes to life in the form of "Projects", each track at D/T has 
                     a set of projects under it led by a "Project Lead" under the guidance of a "Project Guide".<br> 
                     Working on various projects under Dev/Track instills a sense of responsibility among students
                     and gives them a taste of working in a tech eco-space.<br>The process of Development is held in
                     "cycles" with each cycle resulting in an addition to your repo. By the end of an academic year, 
                     students will have a sizable amount of contributions under their name and a sharp set of skills.
                     Experiences at DevTrack cultivate qualities like problem-solving, resourcefulness, collaboration,
                     and many more, which are considered very much essential in a workforce.
                     Ultimately Dev/track tries to prepare students for their eventual careers, careers that are 
                     more than just a job.

                     to collaborate and contribute. Dev/Track provides a forum for students to showcase 
                     their skills while building their repertoire and Resume.  
                     We aim to sculpt an environment to help students realize their potential and encourage them
                     to contribute to a broader tech eco-space.

                  <p style="font-family:Montserrat;">We at Dev/track are dedicated to helping students upskill their stacks while diversifying
                     their portfolios.Each idea comes to life in the form of "Projects", each track at D/T has 
                     a set of projects under it led by a "Project Lead" under the guidance of a "Project Guide".<br> 
                     Working on various projects under Dev/Track instills a sense of responsibility among students
                     and gives them a taste of working in a tech eco-space.<br>The process of Development is held in
                     "cycles" with each cycle resulting in an addition to your repo. By the end of an academic year, 
                     students will have a sizable amount of contributions under their name and a sharp set of skills.
                     Experiences at DevTrack cultivate qualities like problem-solving, resourcefulness, collaboration,
                     and many more, which are considered very much essential in a workforce.
                     Ultimately Dev/track tries to prepare students for their eventual careers, careers that are 
                     more than just a job.
